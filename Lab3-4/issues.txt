1. undo-ing with an empty history list does not print message (i don't think built-in exceptions can print anything)
2. test validators, sort functions, undo
3. add error types to function specification
4. maybe implement compound validators
5. remove errorMsg from assert
7. i should separate sorting from the UI and do sth like printStudentsWithArgument
