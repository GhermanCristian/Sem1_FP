1. undo-ing with an empty history list does not print message (i don't think built-in exceptions can print anything)
2. test sort functions, undo
3. add error types to function specification
4. maybe implement compound validators (and test them)
5. remove errorMsg from assert
6. enhance the menu-thing functionality
